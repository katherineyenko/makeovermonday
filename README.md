## Description
This project is for improving both data visualization and coding skills. As a novice scientist, I find that a lot of good science goes to waste because an average person finds it difficult to interpret visuals attached to an article. As someone that has been in the field for a few years, I notice there is an abundance of visuals that are just painful to look at for various reasons (e.g. way too much information, questionable choices of graphs, colors that hinder proper interpretation, etc.). By practicing with these datasets, I hope to learn more about what makes a good visual and utilize coding languages to do so. The end goal is to satisfy both the graphic designer and scientist, and to balance the visual appeal and informative power of the resulting charts.
